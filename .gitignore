/Saved/

# 4. Engine's heavy-hitter cache (should never be committed).
/DerivedDataCache/

# 5. Build products and deployment directories
/Build/
/Packaged/
/Releases/

# 6. Localization cache/export files

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Git LFS & Gitee Compatibility (Ensure LFS-tracked files are ignored if possible)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# You should commit *.uasset and *.umap (Your core content).
# If Gitee's LFS limitation is strict, they must be tracked as normal files
# by removing LFS tracking, as demonstrated in the previous steps.
# The following lines are for safety/debug, but the core content should NOT be ignored.
# *.uasset
# *.umap

# Ignore common archive/large files that were in your previous gitignore
*.zip
*.rar
*.7z
*.mp4
*.wmv
*.wav
*.mp3
*.ogg
